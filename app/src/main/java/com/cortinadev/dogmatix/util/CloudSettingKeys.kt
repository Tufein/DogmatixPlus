/**
 * Names, types and backup rules of the WebDAV settings that live in `user_settings` (see
 * [com.cortinadev.dogmatix.data.local.CloudSettings]). A pure object so [BackupJson] and
 * `BackupService` can apply the rules without touching DataStore, and the tests can check them.
 *
 * - Every key has a type tag (like [BackupJson]'s `t`): a backed-up value of another type is
 *   dropped, because the typed DataStore reader would throw a ClassCastException on it.
 * - The app password is a **secret that never travels in a backup file**: the other tokens in
 *   `user_settings` do (the backup says so), but those only open one app; this one opens the
 *   user's whole personal cloud. After a restore it is kept only while the restored settings point
 *   at the same server and user ([keepsPassword]); otherwise the user types it again.
 * - The backup passphrase never lives in `user_settings` at all (it is in `dav_device`).
