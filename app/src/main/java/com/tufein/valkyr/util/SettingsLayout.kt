/*
 * 5.0 decision ("the settings were still too extensive"): 10 cards, and in every card only what people
 * actually change shows; the rest sits behind one collapsed "Advanced (N)" row at the end of the card
 * (never lost: search finds it, jumps to it and opens the card). Every key has a [SettingLevel].
 * Switches whose default is right for nearly everyone, steppers with tuning values, per-server limits,
 * battery / night / retry settings, maintenance dialogs and diagnostics are ADVANCED; a master and its
 * dependents are always on the same level (a dependent never sits behind a different door than its switch).
 * Merged since 4.9: Controls into Look, Storage and Torrents into Downloads, After a download into Frontends.
 *
 *  TOOLS      (no heading) everyday: Library tools, Search settings and tools
 *  LOOK       Look and controls
 *               everyday: Theme, Accent colour, App language, Text size, Gamepad layout, Swap A/B X/Y
 *               advanced: TV mode, Second screen, Bold focus ring, Compact lists, Animations, Background glow
 *  LIBRARY    Library and covers
 *               everyday: Profiles, Favourite game languages, Version preference, Covers in the library list, Cover sources
 *               advanced: Maximum search results, Recently played in the icon menu
 *  SOURCES    Sources and new games
 *               everyday: Scan sources automatically (+ every / Wi-Fi / charging / night), Download wishlist
 *               games automatically, Weekly digest
 *               advanced: nothing (so no Advanced row)
 *  DOWNLOADS  Downloads and storage
 *               everyday: Download presets (they set limit and conditions together, so first), Download folder,
 *               Debrid service (+ API key)
 *               advanced: A subfolder per console, Keep free space, Storage (link), Concurrent downloads,
 *               Downloads per server, Speed limit (+ No limit at night), Pick the best source, Retry by itself,
 *               Continue interrupted, Continue the queue after a restart, Metadata timeout
 *  SCHEDULE   When to download
 *               everyday: Wi-Fi, Charging
 *               advanced: Low battery (+ limit), Hot, Night (+ start / end)
 *  FRONTENDS  Frontends and after a download
 *               everyday: Set up ES-DE / iiSU / Daijishō, Emulator per console, Auto-unzip, m3u playlists
 *               advanced: Cocoon, Frontend shortcuts, Frontend check (link), Covers for ES-DE / Pegasus / RetroArch,
 *               Covers for launchers (link), Game details for frontends, Descriptions (link), Queue-done notice
 *  CLOUD      Cloud and saves
 *               everyday: Cloud (hub), RomM server, Save sync, RetroAchievements (link)
 *               advanced: Continue playing on Home
 *  BACKUP     Backup and recovery
 *               everyday: Back up, Automatic backup (+ folder), Restore backup
 *               advanced: Cloud backup, Set up a new handheld (link), Trash and recovery (link)
 *  APP        App and updates
 *               everyday: Check for updates, Report a problem, About
 *               advanced: Include pre-releases, Share diagnostics
 *
 * Rules: a dependent row sits directly under its master. It is hidden while the master is off only
 * when the master explains it by itself; when the explanation lives elsewhere (the night hours
 * are used by three switches in three cards, "No limit at night" needs a speed limit) the row
 * stays visible, dimmed, with the reason as its hint ([SettingsLayout.inactiveReason]).
 * Rows that open a tool or hub are single link rows, never copies of the tool itself.
